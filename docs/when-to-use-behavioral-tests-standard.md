# When to Use Behavioral Tests Standard

## Purpose
Clarify when behavioral tests are the best tool for the job.

## Standard
- Use behavioral tests to capture high-level business requirements and functional behavior.
- Prefer solitary unit tests for heavily algorithmic code or where white-box testing is more maintainable.
- Use behavioral tests for documentation and coverage of business rules, not for low-level implementation details.

## Rationale
Choosing the right testing approach ensures maintainability, coverage, and clarity in the codebase.

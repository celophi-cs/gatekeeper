## Project Overview
Gatekeeper is an AI-first, standalone OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect authentication platform inspired by Auth0, Okta, and Firebase Auth. The project is built during a hackathon to showcase agentic, AI-augmented development workflows for complex, security-critical infrastructure.

## Hackathon Challenge & Goals
- Build a self-contained identity provider for user authentication and authorization
- Leverage AI tools and agents for code generation, architecture, testing, documentation, and automation
- Demonstrate secure, thoughtful implementation of core authentication features

## Core Requirements
- User registration and login with secure password handling
- OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE
- JWT access and refresh token issuance
- Developer portal/API for client app registration
- Basic user management

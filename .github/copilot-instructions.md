# Copilot Instructions

This file contains guidelines and instructions for using GitHub Copilot in this repository.

## Workflow Expectations
Before starting on a task, Copilot must plan out the task like a master architect—favoring simplicity and prioritizing testing as the most important part of any system.

Copilot must evaluate the files in the "docs" folder to determine if there are any standards that need to be known before beginning work.

After getting familiar with the standards, Copilot should begin to implement. Throughout the process, Copilot should write tests in the test project, build the solution, and run the tests to maintain a strong feedback loop.

## Decision Making and Focus
Copilot should ask questions if an important decision needs to be made. Copilot should stay focused on the given task and not go off on tangents or perform tasks that were not asked. If there is something that needs to be addressed beforehand, Copilot should ask about it before proceeding.

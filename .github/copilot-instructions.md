# Copilot Instructions

This file contains guidelines and instructions for using GitHub Copilot in this repository.

## Workflow Expectations
Before starting on a task, Copilot must plan out the task like a master architect—favoring simplicity and prioritizing testing as the most important part of any system.

Copilot must evaluate the files in the "docs" folder to determine if there are any standards that need to be known before beginning work.

After getting familiar with the standards, Copilot should begin to implement. Throughout the process, Copilot should write tests in the test project, build the solution, and run the tests to maintain a strong feedback loop.

## Decision Making and Focus
Copilot should pre-emptively perform tasks to solve bugs, problems, or features. Do not wait for user instructions if something is obviously missing or needs to be done.

When writing code, Copilot should focus on writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. Always consider edge cases and error handling.
